    "# Grover's Algorithm on 1-IN-3-SAT\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've been focusing on fairly simple systems designed solely for observing and understanding mysterious behavior quantum mechanics. Now, we'll put our engineering hat's on and build a circuit that will actually solve a real (albeit small scale) problem. Although the problem we'll tackle is small, it is by no means easy. In fact, let's go straight for some of the hardest (yet most important) types of problems studied, a $\\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a quick recap on complexity theory, so we can really appreciate what we're about to do. Algorithms can be compared in terms of how much space (memory) or time (number of operations) they require, in terms of their input size (denoted $N$). Algorithms can be classified into different sets, for example, the set of polynomial algorithms (denoted $\\mathcal{P}$) comprises of all the algorithms that require on the order of a polynomial steps in the input, denoted $\\mathcal{O}(N^K)$ for some $K$. Another important set is the set of non-deterministic polynomial algorithms (denoted $\\mathcal{NP}$). A subset of $\\mathcal{NP}$ problems are $\\mathcal{NP}$-complete, so called because any problem in $\\mathcal{NP}$ can efficiently be transformed into an $\\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics is \"$\\mathcal{P}$ vs $\\mathcal{NP}$\" which asks whether or not the sets $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{NP}$ are actually the same. It's hard to understate the importance of this question because if it turns out $\\mathcal{P}=\\mathcal{NP}$ then that would mean there exists an efficient (meaning polynomial time) algorithm to solve any $\\mathcal{NP}$ problem, and many of the most interesting problems we would like to solve are in $\\mathcal{NP}$. One way to prove $\\mathcal{P}=\\mathcal{NP}$ is to develop an efficient algorithm for any one $\\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem. Currently, the only algorithms we know to solve $\\mathcal{NP}$-complete problems are exponential in time ($\\mathcal{O}(K^N)$ for some $K$). A very popular family of $\\mathcal{NP}$-complete problems solve for satisfiability of boolean expressions, which is what we'll be investigating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now before you start thinking you have to solve \"$\\mathcal{P}$ vs $\\mathcal{NP}$\" for homework (but extra credit if you do, in addition to instant world fame, a Field's medal, and millions of dollars worth of prizes!), what we're actually going to do is apply Grover's algorithm to the 1-IN-3-SAT problem. Grover's algorithm takes advantage of quantum mechanics to find solutions to a problem in $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt N)$, where $N$ is the number of possibilities (eg. database size), which allows us to solve the 1-IN-3-SAT problems faster than any classical algorithm."

    "Before diving in to $\\mathcal{NP}$-Complete problems and quantum circuits that are several pages long, let's get an idea for boolean logic with quantum circuits. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two interesting properties of quantum circuits to consider: reversibility and no cloning. Remember that all the quantum circuits (up to measurement) are in theory fully reversible. Additionally, the no-cloning theorem tells us that given a qubit in some unknown state, there's no way to duplicate the state on another qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two properties require us to use separate input and output registers (qubits), and to be careful about undoing any operations that change our input qubits for future operations. Additionally, we will employ auxiliary qubits, or \"ancilla,\" that will store intermediate values during computation. Just as we have to be hygenic about our input register, we will have to undo our operations on the ancilla to keep their state consistent (also referred to as keeping them \"clean\").\n",
    "\n",
    "With this formalism, there are a handful of common logic gates that are particularly easy to implement: `NOT`, `XOR`, and `AND`. This small set of gates is already complete, which means we can build any boolean logic circuit with these gates alone. The three functions below implement classical `AND`, `NOT`, `XOR` gates in a quantum circuit (`circ`) given the input (`a`,`b`) and output (`y`) quantum registers."

Unfortunately, SAT, and the related 3-SAT problems are $\\mathcal{NP}$-complete, so there might not exist an efficient algorithm for finding assignments to the variables which will satisfy the expression.\n",
