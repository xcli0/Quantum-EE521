    "Quantum Mechanics has fundamentally changed the way we study natural phenomena on microscopic scales. However, we've only just started to realize how quantum mechanics can also revolutionize information processing and computer science. Making use of the powerful albeit sometimes unintuitive quantum phenomena has created the new and promising field of quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical information processing begins with a bit, and analogously quantum computing begins with a qubit. Information is measured in bits, where each bit will only ever be in one of two possible states (commonly referred to as \"0\" and \"1\"). A qubit is a two state quantum-system, so it's quite similar in that they only ever hold one bit of information, but the superposition principle in quantum mechanics allows a qubit to occupy any one of the continuum of states in hilbert space - sounds like a contradiction, huh?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that eventhough a quantum system can occupy any state in hilbert space, the only way we can get information from a qubit is by measuring it, at which point the state will collapse to one of the two possible basis states. For simplicity, let's choose a measurement operator which communtes with the hamiltonian of our system, so we don't have to worry about the time dependence of our system. Now we can define the two eigenstates of our measurement operator to be $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ which forms our \"computational basis.\" (In practice, the measurement operator that forms our computational basis usually is the hamiltonian.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So in general, the state of our qubit $|\\psi \\rangle$ can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |\\psi \\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for any $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$."
